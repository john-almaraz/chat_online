# 🔁 Real-Time Chat with Kafka and Hexagonal Architecture
**(IN PROGRESS)**
This project is a demonstration of a real-time chat system using Apache Kafka for user-to-user messaging. Each microservice instance represents a single user capable of sending and receiving messages bidirectionally.

The goal is to demonstrate the use of Kafka, WebSockets, and Hexagonal Architecture in a modern and scalable environment.
